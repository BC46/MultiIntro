# MultiIntro Updated
This project builds on the [MultiIntro plugin for Freelancer (2003) by M0tah](https://forge.the-starport.net/projects/multiintro) to provide several new features and fixes.
The [changelog](https://github.com/BC46/MultiIntro-Updated/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) lists all the changes that have been made on top of the original plugin.

## Description
Allows more than three intro screens to be displayed. It will also pick one at random when returning to the intro screen instead of sticking to the one chosen at startup.
